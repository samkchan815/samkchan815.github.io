### Da Vinci Nerve Fiber Microscopy Image Analysis
[Github Repository](https://github.com/Gomez-Lab/Neuronal-Image-Processing)

The nerve segmentation analysis involved developing a comprehensive image analysis pipeline to quantify nerve fibers in pig skin microscopy images. Approximately 100 raw z-stack tissue images were first preprocessed to enhance quality and consistency, testing multiple denoising and normalization methods to determine optimal approaches. Downstream analyses extracted quantitative metrics such as fiber density, length, and orientation. The pipeline integrated image preprocessing, segmentation, and statistical analysis, allowing reproducible and scalable evaluation of nerve morphology for research and computational modeling.

### DermaMNIST Multi_Class Classification

[View Project Here]()

Using the DermaMNIST dataset, this project uses a convolutional neural network to classify dermatological images into seven skin lesion categories. The dataset contains approximately 10,000 dermatoscope images. The CNN utilizes convolutional and pooling layers for hierarchical feature extraction, combined with activation functions and dropout layers to improve learning and prevent overfitting.

images, achieving accurate segmentation that enabled downstream quantitative analysis.
- Conducted comprehensive image analysis using Python programming to determine optimal denoising filters to improve image quality,
leveraging a combination of filters and deep learning methods.
- Processed nerve cell images with thresholding to extract pixel-density metrics and create visualizations for computational analysis using
Matplotlib.
- Created a preprocessing pipeline for the analysis of fiber lengths and angles in microscopy images. Extracted, cleaned, processed, and
analyzed collagen fiber data using Python Pandas package and created visualizations and plots using matplotlib.

**Machine Learning Undergraduate Researcher @ University of California - Santa Cruz Braingeneers Group (_September 2023 - March 2024_)**
- Built an internal Python-based LLM system using PyTorch and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to surface lab-specific
documentation and experimental knowledge, reducing time spent searching for internal resources.
- Implemented an MQTT bridge between Slack and a large language model to allow for AI responses through Slack channels.

**Machine Learning Intern @ Immergo Labs (_June 2023 - August 2023_)**
